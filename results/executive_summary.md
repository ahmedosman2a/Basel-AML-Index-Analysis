# Executive Summary

## Key Findings

### Global Risk Distribution
- **Mean AML Risk**: 5.37/10 across 203 countries
- **Risk Categories**: 25% each in Low/Medium/High/Very High risk quartiles
- **Regional Variation**: Significant differences between FSRB regions (p<0.001)
- **Highest Risk**: Afghanistan, Myanmar, Democratic Republic of Congo
- **Lowest Risk**: Finland, New Zealand, Estonia

### Component Analysis
- **Strong Correlations**: Financial and public transparency (r=0.67)
- **PCA Results**: First two components explain 69% of variance
- **Feature Importance**: Financial transparency most predictive of overall risk
- **Regional Profiles**: FATF members show consistently lower risk across all pillars

### Regulatory Impact
- **Most Effective**: UN sanctions (Cohen's d = 2.05, large effect)
- **FATF Measures**: Grey list countries 1.4 points higher risk on average
- **Cumulative Effect**: Risk increases linearly with sanction count (R² = 0.73)
- **Interaction Effects**: FATF measures amplify impact of other sanctions

### Predictive Modeling
- **Best Model**: Gradient Boosting (R² = 0.955, RMSE = 0.303)
- **Key Predictors**: Financial transparency, corruption, sanctions burden
- **Decision Tree**: 89% accuracy classifying high/low risk countries
- **Policy Thresholds**: Financial transparency <4.0 strongly predicts high risk

## Policy Implications

1. **Financial Transparency**: Single most important factor for risk reduction
2. **Regional Cooperation**: FSRB membership associated with improved outcomes
3. **Sanctions Effectiveness**: Multiple sanctions have cumulative deterrent effect
4. **Targeted Interventions**: 15 countries account for >50% of global high-risk exposure

## Methodological Strengths

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: 203 countries with robust statistical methods
- **Multiple Validation**: Cross-validation and sensitivity analysis throughout
- **Policy Relevance**: Interpretable models with actionable thresholds
- **Reproducible**: Open methodology with documented processing pipeline
